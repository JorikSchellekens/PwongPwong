# PWONG!
PWONG! PWONG! Beat gravity before it gets boring. This game is surprisingly
addictive. The opponent does get a little harder over time. There are no 
instructions to this game but it might take you a while to figure out what the 
spacebar does.

## About
This game was made as a project during my first year in Trinity College Dublin 
(2016-2017)

## Installation
Clone and compile with processing-core.

## Side note
I really don't like processing but it does work. I'll let it stand.
